        Process

    <p>
        The first step I took was planning how I wanted my program to function. I went in knowing I wanted multiple
        search
        functionalities, and in my final project I settled on having a search feature depending on a typed Pokémon name
        and
        a search filter utilizing Pokémon types.
        <br>
        By the prototype phase, I figured the name search feature but was having difficulties with the type search
        feature.
        I also had minimal CSS. During the class period, people recommended reorganizing Pokémon information and gave
        ideas
        regarding reworking the search features. They also gave me other ideas for CSS design that react to user
        interaction.
        <br>
        Afterward, I sorted out the type search feature with checkboxes, worked on error-handling by testing different
        inputs, and added more to the design through CSS.

        <li>Users can also hit the Enter key instead of the search button to trigger the search feature. </li>
        <li>The type search feature accounts for both mono and dual type Pokemon. For instance, if the user selects the
            water checkbox, they can see a pokemon with a water and ground type combination. If the user selects the
            water
            and ground checkbox, they cannot see pokemon that only have the water type.</li>

            I make use of local storage by saving the last radio button selection and search term.
        </li>
        <li>
            Controls include the radio buttons, search button, search bar (name search), previous button (name search),
            next
            button (name search), and the checkboxes (type search).
        </li>
        <li>
            Utilized HTML and CSS for the site's design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Widgets are labeled and follow coding conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Instructions are provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            Errors are accounted for (typing in something that isn't a Pokémon name, checking too many or few
            checkboxes,
            not typing anything in the search bar, clicking previous or next when on the first/last Pokémon, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
            The state updates to show what is being displayed/searched through the status div. If there is nothing, it
            displays that.
        </li>
        <li>
            The site works on 1080x800 screens.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML and CSS are valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Coding conventions were followed (no var, avoiding repeating code, etc.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I think I deserve around a 90 on the project. I added extra controls and functionalities but I could do more in how
    the
    information is displayed.
